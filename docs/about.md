## Personal Philosophy

I believe that testing is not just about finding bugs; it's about understanding the user's journey and ensuring every interaction is seamless and reliable. My background in electronics and communication engineering (B.E.) provides me with a solid foundation for logical troubleshooting and system analysis.
